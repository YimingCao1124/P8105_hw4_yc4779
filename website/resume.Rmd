# Projects

**Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling on User Review Dataset**

- Grouped customer reviews into clusters and uncovered latent semantic structures using Python.
- Preprocessed text data through tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, and feature extraction with Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Applied unsupervised learning models including K-Means clustering and LDA.
- Identified latent topics and representative keywords for each review cluster to enhance interpretability.
- Visualized training results via dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications Industry**

- Developed predictive algorithms for telecom service providers to estimate customer churn probability using Python and Apache Spark.
- Performed data preprocessing including cleaning, categorical feature transformation, and standardization to ensure model readiness.
- Trained supervised machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, with regularization and hyperparameter tuning to mitigate overfitting.
- Evaluated model performance (Accuracy/F1-score) through k-fold cross-validation and conducted feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of customer churn.

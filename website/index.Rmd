# About

I'm a data science practitioner with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data engineering, and machine learning. I hold a B.S. in Statistics from UC Davis and will begin my graduate studies at Columbia University. Previously, I interned at Tencent's Sustainable Social Value (SSV) Data & AI Center, where I participated in the development of large language model (LLM) applications and contributed to machine learning and data science projects.

My work focuses on transforming complex, high-dimensional data into structured, interpretable insights to support evidence-based decision-making. I'm proficient in Python, R, and SQL, and experienced across the full data pipelineâ€”from preprocessing and modeling to visualization and communication. I aim to develop scalable, data-driven systems that can drive impact across sectors like health, sustainability, and public services.
